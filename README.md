"Lasergate 2000" is a distance-based signal gate that keeps a microphone muted until a person steps in front of it. It's useful for installations and live situations, etc., where noise leak to the microphone should be prevented until someone really wants to use the mic. Without a physical switch the usability is hands-free and convenient for many situations.

The gadget uses a TOF (time of flight) sensor for measuring distance, and an Arduino-compatible board for logic. An A5WK relay operates the microphone signal and indication LED's. This version runs on a 9 V battery (doesn't support phantom power).

I designed and built this in 2018 for a sound installation. Feel free to use the circuit diagram and Arduino sketches for your own purposes! However, if you come up with improvements, please share them with me!
